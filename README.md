## Description
This is the git repository containing code for my HW3 for ASTR202 Astrophysical Fluid Dyanamics.
The file time_evol.py includes code for two time-evolution methods I implemented, using either the Godunov or Lax-Friedrichs method for advection calculations. Diffusion is calculated with the implicit method in both cases.
The notebook includes code and plots for Question 1.1 and 1.3.
The animation for 1.3 can be found in ~/animations, and figures under ~/figures.

## Credits and acknowledgements
I checked my operator splitting code (for the handout exercise in class) with classmate M. Santiago.
All numerical integration & animation code are my own.
